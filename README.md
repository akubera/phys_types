# Phys-Types

A C++ type library which provides physical unit types. This includes literals and
automatic conversions between different units.

## Usage

To use, include the header files of the units you would like to use in your program and start
creating objects of the type. Documentation will be created "later".

## (un)License

This header-only library is released into the public domain under unlicense. You may use this for
any purpose, but remember that this library is neither guaranteed to work or provide accurate
physical conversions.

No attribution to this library is required, but it would be a nice thing to do to spread the word.
